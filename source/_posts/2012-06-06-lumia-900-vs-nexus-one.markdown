### Things I Miss about My Nexus One

- *trackball* - The trackball was especially handy for cursor positioning in text fields. I also liked that I could set the trackball light to flash when I had notifications.
- *search button* - In-app search via hardware button.  It's going to take me awhile to get used to the Windows Phone search button always taking me to Bing.
- *tab keyboard button* - The "tab" keyboard button was excellent for entering form data on the web.
- *Mint App* - Luckily the Mint website is fully functional in the Windows Phone browser (parts of the website did not work on the Nexus One).
- *Remember the Milk* - There are two decent app-substitutes that use the Remember the Milk API, but they are not good enough - I still find myself using the Remember the Milk full website instead.
- *Gmail App* - Particularly the "undo archive" feature.
- *Alarm App* - The default alarm app on the Nexus One would display how many minutes until an alarm would sound when you set an alarm. This saved me a few times when I accidentally set the alarm to PM instead of AM, because it was really obvious when it showed 20 hours until the alarm went off instead of 8.

### Things I Love about My Lumia 900

- *large screen size* - The [Nexus One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00332YPHQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00332YPHQ&linkCode=as2&tag=moumobinc-20) and [iPhone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G1IP4W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004G1IP4W&linkCode=as2&tag=moumobinc-20) screens look so miniature to me now. I don't know how I ever survived with such a small screen.  With the [Lumia 900](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P5NNDE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007P5NNDE&linkCode=as2&tag=moumobinc-20), It's so much easier to use the on-screen keyboard and surf the web.
- *People Hub App* - People Hub is my preferred method of posting to social networks.  It was several weeks before I installed the Facebook app, and I only did so because I needed the messaging feature.  Even now that I have it installed, I only use it for viewing messages and checking out events. And it does not get the privilege of being a tile on my home screen.  I still haven't installed the Twitter app.
- *edit search keywords* - After using the search functionality on the Nexus One, the search box disappears.  So if I had searched for "wikipedia tree" and then wanted to narrow the search or correct a typo in the search terms,  change the keywords to "wikipedia treehouse", I would have to type the whole phrase in a again.  With the Lumia 900, I can easily edit the search terms and repeat a search.
- *text selection* - I love being able to tap a word and it selects the whole word automatically.  The cursor positioning is pretty nice too, but I don't like the long delay for it to figure out that you want to place the cursor somewhere while you're holding your finger on the screen.


One thing that drives me crazyâ€”the smiley face symbol on the Lumia 900 keyboard is in the same location as the @ symbol was on the Nexus One, so I hit the smiley face symbol on accident all the time. They look really similar if you are just glancing at the keyboard.
